This documentation provides information on how to clone MOODLE environment into local linux and windows machine from docker compose. The docker compose files includes all dependencies which require to run MOODLE application on the Linux  & Windows environment by cloning the Docker compose files from the version control system to the host machine, with minimal effort using containerization platform with a single command, you can spin up and stop new  MOODLE containers on your machine


Package Installed on Docker images:


Server OS : Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS
PHP Version : PHP 7.3.10
MySQL Version :  5.7.27
Additional Packages : git vim net-tools 


MOODLE application URL: http://localhost


PORTS:
        NGINX: 80
        MYSQL: 5073
        PHPMYADMIN: 5074
        MAILHOG: 5076


Note: Moodle application work port “80” if your machine using this port please stop the respective service and start moodle docker



**Procedure of MOODLE Docker For UBUNTU:**


1. Clone MOODLE Docker project folder from bitbucket to in your machine


BITBUCKET URL: git clone git@bitbucket.org:linkstreet/moodle-docker.git
                                                                  
2. Open .env file and provide moodle & moodledata project folder path 
     
3. Type command called docker-compose up -d  and it creates MOODLE docker container and make application run and up
                     
4. Open moodle config.php and update database details


                                                        $CFG->dbtype        = 'mysqli';
                                                        $CFG->dbhost        = 'moodle-mysql'
                                                        $CFG->dbname        = 'moodle';
                                                        $CFG->dbuser        = 'root';
                                                         $CFG->dbpass        = 'root'
                           
                                                       $CFG->dataroot  = '/var/www/moodledata';

5. Once application up browse URL http://localhost:5074  for phpmyadmin to import/create MOODLE database with below credentials. 
                                                       
                                                             Server: moodle-mysql
                                                             Username: root

6.  Once import database and type below URL in your browser and follow installation steps of moodle 
                      
                          Moodle Application URL: http://localhost
                          Moodle PHPMYADMIN: http://localhost:5074
                          Moodle  MAILHOG: https://localhost:5076
                       
 
**Procedure of MOODLE Docker For Windows:**


1. Window machine requires Docker tool software to run docker commands in the application and please find below link to download


                     Link: https://download.docker.com/win/stable/DockerToolbox.exe


2. Run downloaded .exe file to install application in windows machine

3. Once setup finish open Docker application on the desktop by clicking the icon
                                          
4. Please wait a few minutes  to create a virtual machine for docker application

5. Once finished, it will create a virtual machine IP as per above screenshot note down the same.


6. Here we Clone MOODLE docker files in your windows followed path    
D:\moodle-docker                  
               
               BITBUCKET URL: git clone git@bitbucket.org:linkstreet/moodle-docker.git                         
    
7. Go to the cloned  MOODLE-docker folder and  open .env file and enter moodle and moodledata folder path 
                     
                    Note:  If your project folder exist in other drive such D, E please follow 14th steps to mount folder 
               
8. Open moodle config.php and update database details


                                                        $CFG->dbtype        = 'mysqli';
                                                        $CFG->dbhost        = 'moodle-mysql'
                                                        $CFG->dbname        = 'moodle';
                                                        $CFG->dbuser        = 'root';
                                                        $CFG->dbpass        = 'root'
                                                        $CFG->dataroot  = '/var/www/moodledata';


9. Now it time to run docker command to spin up application by using command as follows
                
                                                CMD:  docker-compose up -d

10. Once command runs it pull images and  create docker container for the MOODLE applications and will take a few minutes 

11.  Once application up browse URL http://192.168.99.100:5074  for phpmyadmin to import MOODLE with below credentials and click Go to phpmyadmin dashboard and restore database into it with name of “MOODLE”
